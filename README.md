# Almost Completed Achievements (v1.3.5)

This addon highlights achievements that are nearly complete, helping you focus on the ones closest to finishing.

## Features
- Scans all achievements and shows those above a customizable completion threshold
- NEW – Reward-filter dropdown: show only achievements that grant Mounts, Pets,
  Titles, Appearances, Drake Customisations, Warband Campsite, or “Other” rewards
- NEW – Per-character Ignore list (replaces old global blacklist)
- “Ignored” tab to review or un-ignore hidden achievements
- Automatic one-time import of old blacklist on first load
- Adjustable slider (50%–100%) to filter results
- Clickable achievement buttons to open them in the default UI
- Works in both Retail and Mists of Pandaria Classic

## Usage

## Version 1.3.5
Scanning Logic:
- Single-scan guard: addon now scans once per session and keeps results in RAM; repeated tab-switches or filter changes only re-filter the cached list instead of re-scanning.
- Scan is only re-triggered when user clicks Refresh, threshold slider changes, ignore list is modified.
- Prevents overlapping scans

Performance / UX:
- Reward-dropdown changes are instant (no wipe, no scan).
- Old achievement rows are cleared before populating a new set (no ghost entries while updating).
- Removed redundant ACA_Cache file-cache hits for the main list; in-memory table is used unless threshold changes.
- Changed parse perameters to smooth out scanning permance hit.

Options tab:
- Threshold slider moved from main panel into dedicated Options tab.
- Includes inline help text explaining the setting.
- Added scan speed dropdown Fast/smooth/slow
- Added anchor options; left or right of the achievements panel
- Open for expansion

Scan progress bar:
- Replaced the old threshold slider slot with a visual progress bar that fills during scans.
- Shows real-time numbers: Scanned / Total (%).
- Bar fill color updated to emerald green (0, 0.8, 0.2, 1) to match the achievement-panel theme; background remains dark-grey 60 % alpha.
- Automatically returns to “Idle” when scan finishes.
