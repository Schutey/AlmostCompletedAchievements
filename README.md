Almost Completed Achievements v2.5

This is a refactor, not a full 3.0, but it adds an entire category filter system, a smarter scanner, Remix mode, better tooltips, and a bundle of QoL fixes while keeping the addon as fast and lightweight as possible.

Category filtering
You can now filter by top-level achievement categories with simple checkboxes:
Characters, Quests, Exploration, Delves, PvP, Dungeons & Raids, Reputation, Pet Battles, Collections, Expansion Features, and Legion: Remix.
There’s also a Toggle All control for quick setup.
Dynamic filters for Professions and World Events

Professions: choose All, Learned, or None. “Learned” only shows achievements relevant to the professions your character actually knows.

World Events: choose All, Active, or None. Active automatically shows current holidays and catches upcoming events around the corner so you don’t miss time-sensitive achievements.

Category filtering works with reward filtering. Narrow the list by category and then refine by reward type to zero in on what you care about.

Remix mode
Automatic enable for Timerunning characters. If you’re in Legion Remix, the addon detects it and focuses the panel appropriately.
Manual toggle remains available with /aca remix to enable/disable on any character.
For flair, the panel title shifts to fel-green while Remix mode is active.

Tooltips
Replaced the default Blizzard achievement tooltip with a progress-aware tooltip tailored to the player:
Shows your current progress at a glance (e.g., X/Y, percent).
Highlights completed vs remaining criteria so you know what’s left.
Condenses reward info right in the tooltip so you don’t have to click through.
Cleaner layout for faster scanning, especially when hovering through a long list.

Reward filtering (expanded)
Filter the list by reward type:
All, Any reward, Mount, Pet, Title, Toy, Appearance, Tabard, Illusion, Drake Customization, Warband Campsite, Bronze Cache variants, Infinite Knowledge, Decor, and Other for the oddballs that don’t fit standard labels.

Smoother, smarter scanning
Auto scan speed adapts to your threshold:
90 Fast,
50–90 Smooth,
<50 Slow.
You can still pick Fast/Smooth/Slow manually.

Better logic under the hood to improve performance.
Quality of life
Reset button to restore defaults quickly.
Toggle All for categories as noted above.
Per-character settings for sane alt behavior.
Persistence across reloads and relogs.
