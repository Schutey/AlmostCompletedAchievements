# Almost Completed Achievements v2.0
Completely Rewritten!

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY
 Scans your entire achievement database and lists every achievement that is not yet completed but is within X % of being done (default 80 %).
 Shows exact progress (criteria done / total) and reward text (mount, title, pet, etc.).
 Click any entry to open the Blizzard Achievement UI directly on that achievement.
 All data is real-time – reflects in-game progress the moment it changes.

## Tabbed Interface
“Almost Completed” – the main list.
“Ignored” – manage hidden achievements (un-ignore with one click).
 “Options” – every setting in one place.

## Reward Filtering
One-click filters for Mounts, Pets, Titles and more instantly

## Better scanning!
Counts partial objectives (e.g. 73/100 kills) instead of simple done/not-done  percentage is now accurate even for multi-step achievements.
Threshold increase to 0-100 

## Scan-Speed Presets
Fast / Smooth / Slow – pick the balance between scan time and FPS comfort.

## Movable
Attach the panel to the left or right side of the Achievement window.

## Full Slash-Command Suite
/aca default – reset every option to factory
/aca ignore 1234 – hide achievement ID 1234
/aca restore 1234 – un-hide it
/aca scanspeed Fast | Smooth | Slow – change CPU load

## Other
Attempted migration of previous version blacklist to current version ignore list automatically.

Every setting you tweak and every achievement you ignore is stored per character—what you do on one alt stays on that alt, automatically.

Plus dozens of small changes and QoL improvements with more to come!
